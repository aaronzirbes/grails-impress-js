Grails Impress.js Editor
========================

Author:		Aaron J. Zirbes <ajz@umn.edu>

Background
----------
I found {this}(http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/) really cool Javascript library to create presentations with, but
I didn't like editing the raw HTML in a single file, so I thought I'd create a web simple app to allow you to create and view presentations
through your browser.

Disclosure
----------

It's kinda kludgy, but it works!

This is a proof-of-concept interface to create fun presentations such as those seen at prezi.com
